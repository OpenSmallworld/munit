# A rather simple test - just writes steps to the Magik prompt
# so you can see the test is doing something.
# If you look at the .feature file you'll see it shows some ways
# of adding comments/documentation. The text straight after a 
# Feature: or Scenario: line is free text. It's only when you
# get a proper Gherking line (say, starting with the word 'Given')
# that the rules get tighter. Text following a # is always free
